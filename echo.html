                Howdy yâ€™all! Iâ€™m c/Lt. Colonel Sean Anthony and Iâ€™ll be your Echo Flight Commander. Iâ€™m a senior and in my fourth
                year of JROTC, itâ€™s a mixture of emotions let me tell you. I joined because I thought that it would be more, 
                interesting, not really sure. I have changed a lot as a person because of RO, because of the people I met in RO 
                and what I learned from them, the challenges that High School brought along with the victories. I donâ€™t have a lot 
                of hobbies to mention. I used to play the drums, I like to listen to music, Iâ€™m a pilot? That last one isnâ€™t really 
                a hobby just one interesting thing about me. You can come talk to me if you have any questions about anything, Iâ€™m 
                very knowledgeable and will help you in whatever way I can ðŸ˜€. See you around!

                <a href = "mailto: saanvikowda@gmail.com"><b>Email: </b>saanvikowda@gmail.com</a><br> 
                <b>Phone Number: </b>(858)-282-9913<br> 
                Hey everyone! Iâ€™m c/TSgt Saanvi Kowda (Iâ€™m Saanvi #1, donâ€™t listen to Saanvi #2â€™s propaganda because Iâ€™m 
                obviously cooler) and this year Iâ€™ll be your Echo Flight Sergeant and Logistics NCO. Iâ€™m now a sophomore at 
                Scripps, and Iâ€™m thrilled to be back to my second home, our beloved CA-935th! Iâ€™m on the Saber Fancy Drill 
                Team, and last year I was also a Logistics and Public Affairs representative, a Kitty Hawk tutor, and the BDIY. 
                Outside of the program, Iâ€™m a member of the Science Olympiad and Red Cross clubs, and I have a weird obsession with 
                astronomy, biology, ornithology, and almost anything science-related. I love reading, eating and snacking, listening to K-pop
                (summoning all ARMYs, CARATs, STAYs, and ONCEs), watching every single K-drama on Netflix, and crocheting. I have a masterâ€™s
                degree in sleeping, and my favorite thing to do besides lazing around is Bharatanatyam (Iâ€™ve been training for 10 years)! A 
                piece of advice Iâ€™d like to give, regardless of where you apply it, is that you should always grab onto opportunities that 
                come your way. You can always gain a new skill, meet new people, or develop leadership and teamwork â€” and CA-935th is the 
                perfect place to do so! Feel free to reach out to me if you ever want to talk about something, RO-related or not. You could be 
                struggling in Mr. Szwastâ€™s class, or just need some life advice â€” and Saanvi #1 is here to help you! For some reason, Iâ€™m 
                concerningly chronically online, so donâ€™t get creeped out if I respond right awayâ€¦
