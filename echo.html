               What’s good everyone, I’m c/2d Lt Noah Beyer and I’ll be your Echo flight commander for the 25-26 school year! As a junior, this will be my third year in the RO, and it has been AMAZING. I chose RO instead of PE because it sounded more interesting, but the program turned out to be far more than I had expected. Throughout my time in the corps, I have made some of my closest friends, had the biggest opportunity to develop my leadership skills, and found a community worth being a part of. I have been a member of cool groups such as Saber Fancy Drill Team (Join Saber!), Logistics, and our operations squadron. The best part about ROTC is the immense amount of opportunities the corps provides. A big piece of advice I would give to incoming high school students is that even if you have the smallest interest in something, go for it! You never know if you truly enjoy something until you try it. My favorite things to do are playing guitar and creating music. I LOVE music. I mainly listen to Indie or Punk Rock, but in reality, I enjoy discovering ALL types of music. Other than music, I like to bike, hike, and discover new foods (but I am NOT a big back). If you ever need to reach me, feel free to send me a message on Discord or find me in person. I can’t wait for the amazing year we’ll have together! :)

                HIIIII!!! I'm c/TSgt Zoya Qureshi, and I’m so excited to be your Echo Flight Sergeant and APT NCO this year!! I’m a sophomore, which means you’ll usually find me stressing over AP Euro and Bio. Some fun facts about me: I LOVEEE dad jokes, I do Kajukenbo, competitive fencing, and I’m also SUPER tall - like 6’7’’ ;))! Last year, I was a part of the Saber Fancy Drill Team, where we won first place at nationals! I was also a member of the first-ever SRHS Raiders Team, the Awareness Presentation Team, and I was the female team captain of the Youth Physical Fitness Team, where we won first place in Cadet Challenge. Last but certainly not least, I was part of the infamous 24-25 Best Drilled Individual Winners, well-known for the sudden bond we formed the weekend before the Best Drilled Individual of the Year Competition. Even today, we’ve remained super close and still have weekly calls to catch up with each other, which leads me to the biggest piece of advice I could give you to succeed in RO - branch out! Don’t be afraid to try out for a new team, participate in BDI, or even talk to someone new! The friends you’ll make in RO will become one of your closest companions who will support you for years to come, but for it to happen, step out of your comfort zone and try something new! With that, have fun and get ready to have an amazing year!!!!!
