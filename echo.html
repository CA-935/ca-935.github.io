            <p>Echo Flight Commander: Harini Akurathi <br>
            <a href = "mailto: harini0731@gmail.com ">harini0731@gmail.com </a><br>(858)-305-0685 <br>Haiii everypony im c/2dLt harini Akurathi and I’m this year’s Echo Flight Commander. I’m a person that loves to work out, being a competitive gymnast, but I also play the piano and I dance and sing Indian classical. Within RO, I’m a part of the Academic Team and the StellarXplorers team. I’m hoping to join more special teams like APT! I love going to drill competitions and spending three hours doing everyone’s hair. No, truly, highlight of my day<3. My hobbies include reading, listening to all genres of music, going to the gym, and studying for my 5 AP classes and Bio/Science Olympiad. RO is easily the highlight of my day, and the best pick-me-up if I’m in a bad mood. You get as much as you put in, so put yourself out there and join a team or two, or volunteer a couple times. You’ll make long-lasting friendships with people who are interested in bettering themselves as people. I’m literally ALWAYS down to talk so shoot me a text if you ever need anything. Elated to meet y’all and make this year another exceptional one!!

            <p>Echo Flight Sgt: Jackeline Du <br>
            <a href = "mailto: Jaqqiedu8@gmail.com ">Jaqqiedu8@gmail.com </a><br>(858)-397-8028 <br>Whaddup bruh? I’m Echo's sergeant, c/TSgt Jackeline or Jackie Du. People tend to call me a grandma but a super hyper person. Last year, I tried out for APT, YPF, Flag Detail, Academic League, PA, LG, and didn’t get into any of them, except for Saber Fancy Drill Team. If you don't know your interests, the RO program is a great place to start if you put your foot forward! I’m hoping to meet new first year nuggets and further expand my RO knowledge/experience. Besides RO, I love filling my photo storage with study aesthetics, listening to music, bothering my friends, researching random topics and lurking on Roblox. I'm also a former flute/piano player and martial artist. For any questions, my Discord and Instagram dms are always open! :>
