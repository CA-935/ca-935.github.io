        <p>Awareness Presentation Team, APT for short, consists of a handful of bright cadets passionate about spreading awareness 
		to elementary and middle school kids on a wide range of topics. We recognize that kids around this age may begin encountering 
		a variety of new problems at school or in their daily lives, whether it be health issues or social issues. Each year our group 
		creates a presentation on a carefully selected topic, which consists of a Powerpoint slideshow and a handwritten play. We intend 
		to present to as many schools as possible, but due to limited time and resources, we only have the chance to visit several schools 
		over the course of the academic school year. 
		<p>Not only is APT beneficial to the kids we present to, but also gives us a chance to help a community that has already given so much to us. 
		APT encourages teamwork, communication, leadership, and most importantly, a sense of pride in what we are able to accomplish and the lives 
		we are able to influence.</p>
