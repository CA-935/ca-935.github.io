            <p>Awareness Presentation Team, APT for short, consists of a handful of bright cadets passionate about spreading
                awareness to elementary and middle school kids on a wide range of topics. We recognize that kids around this
                age may begin encountering a variety of new problems at school or in their daily lives, whether it be health
                issues or social issues. Each year our group creates a presentation on a carefully selected topic, which
                consists of a Powerpoint slideshow and a handwritten play. We intend to present to as many schools as possible,
                but due to limited time and resources, we only have the chance to visit several schools over the course of
                the academic school year.
                <p>Not only is APT beneficial to the kids we present to, but also gives us a chance to help a community that
                    has already given so much to us. APT encourages teamwork, communication, leadership, and most importantly,
                    a sense of pride in what we are able to accomplish and the lives we are able to influence.
