            <p>Youth Physical Fitness (YPF) is a competition that challenges an individual's physical prowess, as well as their ability to work in a team. It consists of a male and female
                team with 6 members each (including an alternate) from all the schools in the SDUSD Brigade. The events are the 20 meter crab walk, basketball throw, power throw, and a 400 
                meter relay race. The schools will compete against one another to score the most points at the competition to win 1st place. This year, YPF is led by c/2dLt Evangeline
                Bennett, c/2ndLt Sean Anthony, and c/TSgt Rowan Sullivan.</p>
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2022-2023 School Year:</p>
