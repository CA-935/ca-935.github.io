            <p>Educational aid is a very important factor to consider to help yourself financially as well as mentally. 
            About 3.9 million students drop out from college because of debt and non-affordability. Therefor our aim is to support
            and help you guys to get the proper aid that we all deserve and also make college more affordable. Hello, Iâ€™m c/MSgt 
            Mia Canales. As Education Officer, along with my sergeant, c/TSgt Vivian Wang, we compile lists of possible scholarships 
            and learning opportunities for cadets. Our goal is to provide support to those seeking out for educational benefits 
            and aids.
