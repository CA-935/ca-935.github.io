            <p>Stellar Xplorers is a team that competes in the StellarXplorers National Space Design Competition over the course of 4 months, 
				at the very least. There are two types of rounds, Practice and Qualification Rounds. Points gained from Qualification Rounds 
				contribute to the teamâ€™s overall score and will be the deciding factor on whether they progress into the Semi-Finals or not. 
				Challenges include scenarios based on orbital mechanics and data analysis, which test skills in problem-solving, collaboration, 
				and other areas. Over the past 6 years, our unit has triumphed in the Semi-Final and Final rounds. This year, c/2d Lt Heather 
				Ngo and c/TSgt Sarah Zheng will lead the team to strive for a place in the Finals!              
		<p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2024-2025 School Year:</p> 
            <p </br></b>Qualification Round 1 (Nov. 3) - All three teams placed in the top 200 teams, Varsity taking 77th place nationally </br>
		Qualification Round 2 (Dec. 8) - All three teams placed in the top 150 teams, Varsity taking 39th place nationally </br>
		Qualification Round 3 (Jan. 25) - All three teams placed in the top 150 teams, JVA taking 17th place nationally </br>
		Junior Varsity A and Junior Varsity B both qualified for the Semi-Final Round (Feb. 14)</br>
