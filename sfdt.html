            <p>Saber Team is a group of our unitâ€™s finest drillers, wielding not rifles but swords. Saber combines the hallmarks of all fancy drill teams. It features complex 
                formations and rhythmic movements, but is also involved in other school events. Members work to efficiently, effectively, and consistently sharpen their skills 
                in both exhibition and regulation drill. All team members are instructed by our team leads for this year, c/2d Lt Bella Phan and c/TSgt Daniel Yang. Cadets are 
                expected to uphold the utmost level of discipline, coordination, and performance so the team is always competition worthy. </p>
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2023-2024 School Year:</p>
