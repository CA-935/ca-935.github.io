            <p>Saber Team is a group of dedicated and hard-working individuals who constantly hone their skills in fancy drill.
                Members work together to be an efficient, effective, and consistent drill team capable of facing any challenge.
                Incoming team members will be taught all necessary movements to perform alongside their teammates in competitions.
                They will be required to maintain discipline, coordination, and good work ethic that current members of Saber
                Team deem acceptable. This year the team is led by c/2d Lt. Jonathan Jiang and c/TSgt
                Caleb Shin.</p>
