            <p>Saber Team is a group of our unitâ€™s finest drillers, wielding not rifles but swords. Saber combines the hallmarks of all fancy drill teams, as we feature complex 
                formations and rhythmic movements, but are also involved in other school events. Members work to efficiently, effectively, and consistently sharpen their skills 
                in both exhibition and regulation drill. All team members are instructed by our team leads for this year, c/2dLt. Caleb Shin and c/TSgt Bella Phan. Cadets are 
                expected to uphold the utmost level of discipline, coordination, and performance in order for the team to always be competition worthy. </p>
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2022-2023 School Year:</p>
