                HEYA! (louder than everyone else) I’m c/2dLt Crystal Hooi and I'll be your Foxtrot Flight commander and the
            Logistics AOIC for the 24-25 school year! I am a Junior and this'll be my third year in AFJROTC. During my past 
            two years in the AFJROTC program, I was the BDIY for the 22-23 school year, was a member of the Awareness 
            Presentation Team, was a Logistics representative, then the Logistics NCO, and now I am the Logistics AOIC and 
            the Foxtrot Flight commander! Outside of JROTC, I am the VP of the Origami Club and the upcoming Writer's Bug 
            Club (you should definitely join *wink wink*). I enjoy playing piano, playing Arsenal and Dress to Impress on 
            Roblox, late night manhwa munching, watching anime, drawing, making origami, and listening to music (especially 
            Laufey, Chappell Roan, Ado, and Mitski)! I'm also Malaysian/Indonesian/Chinese and my personality type is 
            INTJ/INFJ! I look forward to meeting all of y’all and I hope we have a slaytastic year! :3

                Hi guys! I’m c/TSgt Noah Beyer, and I will be your Foxtrot flight sergeant! This year will be my second year 
                in RO as a sophomore and I'm on the Saber Fancy Drill Team (Join Saber!). I cannot express enough the 
                positive impact this program has made on my life. I originally joined RO because it seemed like a preferable
                alternative to regular PE, but I never anticipated the great community that came with it. The program has 
                immensely helped me with my confidence, leadership, and being a better person to others. My main hobby is 
                playing guitar. I mostly play rock with my friends but I also enjoy playing jazz, especially Laufey. Other 
                things I enjoy doing are reading, casual gaming, and hiking. My favorite genre of music is alternative rock 
                (Foo Fighters, Green Day, Linkin Park), but I enjoy listening to other genres just as much as rock. My 
                academic tip for first years is to know how to be organized and time-manage. In general, don’t pass on the 
                opportunities you get this year and take initiative. Maybe you want to do something but have doubts and 
                second-guess yourself. Do it anyway! I assure you you won’t regret it. If you have any questions about 
                school, RO, or life, or just want to talk, feel free to reach out. I cannot wait to get to know you guys 
                this year!
