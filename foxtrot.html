                Hello!! I am c/2d Lt Heather Ngo, this year’s Foxtrot Flight Commander. This is my third year in 
            the program. I am a part of Saber Team (join saber!) and am also the commander of Stellar Xplorers 
            (join stellar too!!). I was previously a Logistics representative as well, so you could say that I’ve 
            been pretty involved in the corps. At first, I was hesitant to join AFJROTC, but these past two years 
            in the program have made me realize how much fun it is! I’ve made many friends through it and gained 
            new experiences. I spend my time crocheting and listening to music. Some of my favorite artists are 
            Benson Boone, Mad Tsai, Paramore, and The Cardigans. Whenever I’m not busy, I also love to read. My 
            favorite genres are mystery, fantasy, and romance. I’m really into Greek mythology, so I’ve become a 
            big fan of any book written by Rick Riordan! You can talk to me about any book and I’ll gladly listen 
            :D (and probably add it to my ever-growing tbr…). A little piece of advice I have for first years is 
            that there are so many ways to be involved within this unit, so go try out for anything that interests 
            you! I can’t wait to have an amazing year with you all <3

                Hello!!! I am c/TSgt Hasini Thamidala and I’ll be your Foxtrot Flight Sergeant for the 2025-2026 school 
                year. I am a sophomore and it is my second year in AFJROTC. Joining RO, was one the best decisions I have 
                made. Through my first year in ROTC I was able to make many new friends and learn aspects of leadership 
                and confidence. Outside of ROTC, I am part of the Science Olympiad Club and on the school’s badminton team. 
                Some fun facts about me are that I play tennis and badminton, dance, and play the piano. A piece of advice 
                I have is to try out and get involved in anything that interests you! If you have any questions or just want 
                to talk, don’t hesitate to reach out! I am looking forward to an amazing year and to getting to know you all! 
                :)
