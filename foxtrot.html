                Hi! My name is c/2dt lt Isabella Lo, but people know me as Izzie, and this year I will be your Foxtrot Flight Commander as well as your Awards Officer. I am a junior and this will be my third year in the program. You'll hear it a lot but AFJROTC is really a great program to be involved with. Personally, I've found my place in our Saber Fancy Drill Team, Kitty Hawk, Logistics, and Public Affairs, but there are so many other opportunities to look into. Outside of JROTC, I play violin, dote on my cat, and do anything art related. I'm a pretty open and friendly person so feel free to approach me about anything, I can't wait to get to know all you guys :3

                ୧Helloooo! I’m c/TSgt Isabella Nguyen and I’ll be your Foxtrot Flight Sergeant and Kitty Hawk Sergeant this year! I’m also a sophomore that’s not excited about their messed up schedule ( ༎ຶ⌑༎ຶ ). This is my 2nd year in AFJROTC and I’m a member of the Unarmed Drill Team (join Unarmed <3), the Kitty Hawk Squadron, and formerly Logistics. Outside of RO, I play the piano, swim, and draw eyeballs and random faces when I’m bored. I also luv listening to music but my music taste is pretty basic (heh). I started off RO as a pretty shy cadet, but after getting more involved in RO, and chatting with a lot of other cadets, I can safely say joining AFJROTC was the best decision I made my freshman year. I’m excited to help and watch you first years grow into confident leaders, and hope we get to know each another. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)=ε/̵̿̿/'̿ Shoot me a DM because I’m on Discord too often-
