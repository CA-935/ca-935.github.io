                Hello! I’m c/2d Lt Sonakshi Kanakala and I’ll be your Golf Flight Commander and APT AOIC this school year! 
                I’m currently a junior and this is my third year in the program. Initially, I joined RO to get out of PE but
                it ended up being much more than I hoped for. You’ll hear this a lot but don’t be afraid to step outside of 
                your comfort zone and try new things. In my free time I enjoy playing Candy Crush, binge-watching Modern 
                Family, reading, and volunteering. Also, I’m a sucker for silly dad puns and knock knock jokes. I’m so 
                honored to introduce you to this wonderful community that I hope you can call home. If you need to complain, 
                rant, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out! I can’t wait to get to know each and every one of you; 
                let’s make the most out of this year! :’)

                Hello peeps!! I’m c/TSgt Monica Chan. This year I will be your fellow Golf flight sergeant! This is my 
                second year in RO, and I am a sophomore this year. I am a member of our unit’s Saber Fancy Drill Team, and 
                I was formerly in logistics. I transferred into RO just to escape having to run laps in PE last year, and 
                now it turned out to be one of my best decisions! RO turned out to be way more intriguing than expected 
                because of all the opportunities it offered and all the great friends I made throughout the year. Outside of 
                school, I enjoy singing, listening to music (some artists include Jay Chou, G.E.M, JJ Lin, Vocaloid, and
                more), drawing, watching c-drama and anime, and reading manga/manhwa/manhua. I’m still learning the electric 
                guitar so I’m not very good at it LOL.  My favorite actor is Zhang Ruoyun >:D I am a Chinese-Malaysian. I was 
                born in Shanghai, China and I lived there for almost 10 years!!! Maybe you will ask: “Are you fluent in 
                Chinese?” The answer is YES!! I can speak Chinese and English so feel free to talk to me in BOTH!! My MBTI is
                ISTP and I really LOVE chinese food :D If you ever see me around, don’t be scared to say hi and yap with 
                me!!!! I promise I won't bite!! I hope all of you guys have a fabulous time in RO!!! ^^
