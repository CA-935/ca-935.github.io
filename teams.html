        <p>There are five drill teams at CA-935th, two being ceremonial, and three being exhibition. The Drill Teams squadron is consisted of Armed Fancy Drill Team (AFDT), Unarmed Fancy Drill Team (UFDT), Saber Fancy Drill Team (SFDT), Color Guard, and Flag Detail, all led by the Teams Commander, c/Capt Kathie Kwon. Every team is involved in various ways, Color Guard presenting the colors at varsity football games at Scripps Ranch High School, local performances by exhibition teams, and reveille and retreat being covered by the Flag Detail team. Drill Teams at CA-935th are also sent to several competitions every year, such as the Sweetwater Drill Competition and the Golden Bear West Coast Nationals.
