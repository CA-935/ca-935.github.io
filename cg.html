            <p>Color Guard is a ceremonious team consisting of 2-3 flag bearers and 2 riflemen. Throughout the school year, we present the colors and numerous
                community and school events. Our color guard was the number one color guard in SDUSD, placing first in the varsity category and 2nd in the 1st year
                category at the Brigade Drill Competition. In the 2017-2018 school year, the varsity color guard was chosen to compete at the national level in 
                Daytona, Florida. This year the team is led by c/2d Lt David Nasi and c/TSgt Chase Hebert, whose goals are to prepare the team for success and keep
                the title as number one color guard in the Brigade.</p>
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2023-2024 School Year:</p>
