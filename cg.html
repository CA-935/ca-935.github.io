        <p>Color Guard is a ceremonious  team which consist of two flags and two rifle man. Throughout out the school year we present the colors at numerous 
		school events and community events, providing the cadets with numerous hours of community service. Our color guard was the number one color guard in the 
		SDUSD placing first for varsity and 1st year team at the brigade drill competition. In the 2016-2017 school year the varsity color guard was chosen to compete 
		at a national drill competition in Daytona Florida. This year the team is led by c/2nd Lt William Rule and c/2nd Lt Marlene Freerksen, whose goals are to 
		prepare the team for success and to keep the title as the number one color guard.</p>
		<p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2016-2017 School Year:</p>
