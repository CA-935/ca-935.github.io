            <p>Color Guard is a ceremonious team which consist of two flags and two rifle men. Throughout out the school year
                we present the colors at numerous school events and community events, providing the cadets with numerous
                hours of community service. Our color guard was the number one color guard in the SDUSD placing first for
                varsity and 1st year team at the brigade drill competition. In the 2017-2018 school year the varsity color
                guard was chosen to compete at a national drill competition in Daytona Florida. This year the team is led
                by c/2d Lt Joylyn Lew and c/TSgt Elliot Mell, whose goals are to prepare the team for success
                and to keep the title as the number one color guard.</p>
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2020-2021 School Year:</p>
