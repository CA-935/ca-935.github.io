                What’s lookin good cookin (¬ ₃ ͡¬) ? I’m Samiya (or Sami) Soman and I’ll be your Alpha Flight Commander this year! I am a senior here at SRHS, and I’ve been part of AFJROTC all four years. In the unit, I’ve been affiliated with Ops, Comptroller, Unarmed, Kitty Hawk, and Academic Bowl. As an initially timid freshman, I instantly fell in love with the program, as it shaped me into a more confident and organized individual, which in turn made me a more well-rounded high school student. My main hobbies are thrifting, walking, and listening to music (aespa, A$AP, newjeans, lamp, chappell roan, w2e, etc…so basically all genres!!). Every now and then, I hop on Minecraft, horror, and other pc games with my well-knit group of friends whom I adore very much. I also like trinkets like miffy, moomin, mofusand, summikogurashi, etc!! A few quick facts: I’m wasian, a sagittarius, an INFP, I can’t snap my fingers, I’m a Hufflepuff, and I have a third-degree black belt in TaeKwonDo. Since I’m a senior, I know a lot of ins and outs of SRHS, so don’t hesitate to ask me questions about clubs, courses, etc. This is my last year of high school, and I hope it’s also my best one <3  I’m really energetic and spontaneous, so I’m excited to meet you whether I’m your flight commander or not; let’s put 200% effort toward a successful 24-25 school year!!!  ♡⸜(˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)⸝♡

                Hiiiiii! I’m c/Tsgt Ethan Sim, and I’ll be your Alpha Flight Sergeant for 2024-2025! This year will be my second year in this program and I am a sophomore at SRHS. Joining RO has been one of the best decisions I have made in high school; I have created new friendships and had the opportunity to explore new interests because of our corp. In RO, I am on our Saber Fancy Drill Team, Awareness Presentation Team, and formerly Logistics. In my free time, I usually spend it napping, hanging out with friends, playing the guitar, watching K-dramas, drawing, and playing games. I also LOVE listening to music with a few of my favorite artists, including Newjeans, Aespa, and Kiss of Life. Fun fact: I only listen to Kpop :))). Some more fun facts about me are that my MBTI is ESFP-T/ISFP-T, my favorite color is purple, and I hate raspberries. I am almost always available, so feel free to shoot me a dm on Discord or talk to me in person. I’m looking forward to getting to know all of you!!
