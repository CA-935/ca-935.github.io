               Hi guys, I’m c/2d Lt Shayne Maddox and I’ll be your 2025-2026 Alpha Flight commander! I’m a Junior and a 3rd year JROTC cadet here in this unit. Some teams I was and am involved in are Color Guard, AFDT, our Youth Physical Fitness team, Raiders, Flag Detail, and previously Logistics representative and Awards NCO. I joined this program due to interest from my father’s prior service in the USMC, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made in my life. With all of the amazing cadets and upperclassmen to lead and compete alongside had kept me motivated and showed our unit’s prosperity, and it is a decision I will never forget. Previously I was a quiet and shy freshman, but now have a lot of friends across many grades thanks to this unit and its close bond. Even if you don’t have a particular interest in the military, this program is amazing and many people in RO will also tell you so. Other than RO, I like to exercise, listen to music, and play video games. I research(ed) a lot of random things, from motorcycles and watches to rap and game guides, so let me know if you’re interested in any of those :) I hope to get along with you guys this year!

                Hello, my name is c/TSgt Haasini Akurathi, and I will be your 2025-2026 Alpha flight sergeant and LG NCO, so I’ll usually be laboring myself out (eating snacks) in Logistics. I am a sophomore, and a second year in the program, and I cannot wait to see how many more joyful memories I make in the corp. Last year I was a part of the Youth Physical Fitness Team, our first ever Raider’s team, CyberPatriot, and Logistics. I totally recommend trying out for anything and everything that even in the slightest interests you, for both drill teams, and special teams. When I am not thinking about AP Bio and AP Euro I spend most of my time sleeping, watching tv shows (I watch anything and everything, hit me up with recommendations), and going on walks. I am also a huge ocean nerd, and love marine animals and its ecosystem (goodbye Taroko). Some silly facts, im a slytherin,  Some of my favorite music artist and my favorite song of theirs are, the neverminds: haunt me, Magdalena Bay: Vampire in the Corner, EVERY SINGLE SONG SHE-RA IS EDITED TO, wave to earth: Wave, Nastyona:worst case scenario,  Malice Mizer: Aegen, EVERY SINGLE SONG IN THE HTTYD FRANCHISE, Mitski: Old Friend, mabanua: Alan, Lana Del Rey: Art Deco, EVERY SONG IN GENSHIN IMPACT, My Little Pony: Let’s Have a Battle, Arctic Monkeys: Secret Door, THE FROZEN SOUNDTRACK, Fly me to the moon (the version in evangelion) watch Voltron plz, ok bye
