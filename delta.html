                Salutations! Iâ€™m c/2dLt Hailey Shin, this yearâ€™s Delta Flight Commander. Iâ€™m a junior at SRHS, and Iâ€™ve been 
                in the program for 3 years, dabbling in a little bit of everything this program has to offer. I was on Armed 
                Fancy Drill Team for 2 years, competing in our Armed Novice team, including when we won 1st Place at West
                Coast Nationals! A little secret about me (not so secret) is that Iâ€™m a huge yapper, so feel free to talk to 
                me anytime! Iâ€™m always open to talk about RO, school, and anything else. Iâ€™m always down to make new friends 
                and have a fun chat. A few fun facts about me are that #1, Iâ€™m a swim instructor (no I will not give you 
                lessons), #2 I LOVE cats (even though I am allergic), #3 is I might be the coolest person ever (unconfirmed),
                and #4, Iâ€™m an ISTP. I enjoy sleeping, playing the guitar, hanging out with my friends, being a little goofy,
                ice skating, and singing. I look forward to meeting you and I hope me and Saanvi #1 (Iyer) can bring you a great 
                flight experience this year.

                Whatâ€™s up buttercups, itâ€™s c/TSgt Saanvi Iyer here (Saanvi #1â€”because Iâ€™m older, wiser, AND taller), and Iâ€™ll be your 
                Delta Flight Sergeant this year. Iâ€™m a sophomore and in my second year of ROTC. Even though my mom pushed me into it, 
                joining CA-935th has been one of the best choices Iâ€™ve made, and Iâ€™ve found a second family here. This program has taught 
                me leadership, confidence, integrity, teamwork, and so much more. As a flight sergeant, Iâ€™m excited to share what Iâ€™ve 
                learned and help create a positive, motivating environment for everyone. Outside of ROTC, I play volleyball for our schoolâ€™s
                beach volleyball team and a club indoor team. Last year, I was a Kitty Hawk tutor, and Iâ€™m also involved in Red Cross and 
                Science Olympiad at SRHS. A little about me: Iâ€™ve been a Carnatic music singer for 12 years, I play piano, and I love listening
                to musicâ€”mostly R&B and Pop (Iâ€™m open to music recs but no kpop pls ðŸ˜™). I also love traveling and exploring new places; my 
                favorite spots so far are Italy, Bali, Hawaii, and Australia. Iâ€™m an ENTP, so I love to talk and socialize, whether itâ€™s offering
                advice, listening, or just chatting (the Olympics should introduce yapping because I would win gold). Whether youâ€™re new to ROTC 
                or a returning cadet, Hailey and I are here to help you have an amazing experience this year, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out! 
                Looking forward to a great year!
