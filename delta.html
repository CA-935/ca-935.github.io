            <p>Delta Flight Commander: Andres Palacios <br>
            <a href = "mailto: ajpr1910@gmail.com">ajpr1910@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-201-8572<br>Hey hey losers, I’m Andrés Palacios, this year’s Delta Flight Commander. You can probably find me around school being a disaster and failing to find whatever it is I've lost/misplaced. You can also find me at some of the clubs Scripps has to offer, like Academic League and MUN, but the stuff I do in RO is frankly cooler, like Academic Bowl and Color Guard. Outside of extracurriculars, I’m mostly just reading, grabbing food with friends, and suffering as a Chargers fan (the pain never ends), or suffering with schoolwork. I do a lot in RO, and that’s because the more you do in this program, the more you get out of it, the more people you meet, and the more your life is changed for the better (hopefully at least). If y’all have any questions, about anything, or are just bored at 2 AM, hit me up and i’ll respond because I have nothing better to do and am most certainly not going to be sleeping.

            <p>Delta Flight Sergeant: Rithvik Manikandan <br>
            <a href = "mailto: rithviks84@gmail.com">rithviks84@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-265-7531<br>Hello, how’s life everybody? I’m c/TSgt Rithvik Manikandan and I’ll be your Delta flight sergeant this year! I’m a second-year sophomore in our amazing CA-935th Unit, and people call me by many names, ranging from rithu to mankind to Vik-Vik, but Rithvik works just fine :)). RO has been one of the most amazing experiences of not only my high school career, but also my life— over the last year, I’ve formed so many deep friendships, relationships, and feelings of love and camaraderie with my fellow cadets, and this has shaped me into a more social, extroverted, and outgoing individual. Being a part of the Public Affairs, Logistics, and now Operations squadron, I’ve branched out myself and strengthened my interpersonal relationships and life skills by investing myself in various opportunities such as BDI, Drill Teams, and LG/PA responsibilities. I can guarantee that, no matter what else, if you put in the time and effort into this program, you will reap the rewards ten-fold in all the amazing drill competitions, field trips, karaoke nights, and various other exciting perks— you’ll form bonds that last years and memories that last forever— and who knows? you may even find a special saber to hug in your sleep <33. Outside of RO, I love to watch romance and action anime, binge Stranger Things on repeat, read fantasy books, go biking with my buddies, and hang out and relax with my lovely friends :3. If you’re ever feeling down, need a warm hug, or just someone to talk and rant to, shoot me a message or just approach me in person! I’m always glad to be there for you, and this year will be amazing so I hope to get to know each and every one of you!
