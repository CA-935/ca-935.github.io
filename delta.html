                Hey everyone! My name is c/2dLt Nicholas Bai and I’ll be your Delta Flight commander this year. I am currently a junior at SRHS and this is my third year in the program. Aside from RO, I spend most of my time swimming, coding, binge-watching Youtube, and playing hide-n-seek with my missing brain cells. I also have a guilt-free addiction to wasabi flavored almonds (and snacking in general). Regardless, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out – I’d be happy to help. RO is one of the most lit experiences I’ve had in high school and I look forward to the amazing year to come!

                Hiiiiii! My name is Yoonah Lee (no nicknames unfortunately, but you’re welcome to try to make one) and I'm the Delta flight sergeant for next year! I’m an upcoming sophomore, and this will be my second year in ROTC and I can’t wait to meet all the new cadets in the program!!! In JROTC, I’m part of the Academic Bowl Team (you guys should join), and outside of the program, I’m a member of Science Olympiad and the Model United Nations club. I’m so excited to welcome a new group of ROTC cadets, and I hope that all of you have the best experience in RO, especially in Delta flight(best flight ;)). My best piece of advice for you guys would be to simply ask questions and introduce yourself to people, because I promise that's the best way to get to know the flight, and everyone is super friendly. Outside of school, I love anything that's related to skincare and makeup, listening to music, reading, crafting, and shopping for clothes. I also have a small obsession with birds, and will happily tell you all the bird facts you want. If you see me around, strike up a conversation, because I’m always happy to get to know more people! Hope to meet you this year! <3
