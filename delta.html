            <p>Delta Flight Commander: Andres Palacios <br>
            <a href = "mailto: ajpr1910@gmail.com">ajpr1910@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-201-8572<br>Hey hey losers, I’m Andrés Palacios, this year’s Delta Flight Commander. You can probably find me around school being a disaster and failing to find whatever it is I've lost/misplaced. You can also find me at some of the clubs Scripps has to offer, like Academic League and MUN, but the stuff I do in RO is frankly cooler, like Academic Bowl and Color Guard. Outside of extracurriculars, I’m mostly just reading, grabbing food with friends, and suffering as a Chargers fan (the pain never ends), or suffering with schoolwork. I do a lot in RO, and that’s because the more you do in this program, the more you get out of it, the more people you meet, and the more your life is changed for the better (hopefully at least). If y’all have any questions, about anything, or are just bored at 2 AM, hit me up and i’ll respond because I have nothing better to do and am most certainly not going to be sleeping.

            <p>Delta Flight Sergeant: Nicholas Bai <br>
            <a href = "mailto: nicholaszybai@gmail.com">nicholaszybai@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-790-2418<br>How’s it going everyone, I’m c/TSgt Nicholas Bai and I’ll be your Delta Flight Sergeant this year! I am currently a sophomore at SRHS and this is my second year in AFJROTC. RO is definitely one of the best experiences I have had in high school, not only because it has helped me become a more confident and responsible person, but also because it has provided so many opportunities to give back to the community. I can assure you that you will get something more than just PE credits from this program. Some of my hobbies outside of school include swimming, coding, playing video games, and most importantly, napping. I also enjoy binge-watching Youtube (especially Steven He). If you need someone to lean on, rant about classes, or if you just want to talk, feel free to reach out. Although Delta Flight is undoubtedly in a unique situation this year, I’m so excited to be one of your flight sergeants and look forward to the AMAZING ~semester~ to come!
