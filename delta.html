                Hello hello!!!✧‎‧₊˚ I'm c/2dLt Harini Sreeraman, and I'll be your Delta Flight Commander this
                year! As a senior, this will be my fourth year in RO, and I couldn't be more excited- over the 
                course of my time in RO, I've been involved in a range of teams and squadrons, including UFDT, 
                Kitty Hawk, APT, and Logistics (all of which are amazing teams you should join!!! (•̀ᴗ•́)و) 
                During my years here, I've had the best time, and it's been such an amazing opportunity to grow 
                as an individual, make lifelong connections, and experience leadership. My biggest advice would 
                be to get involved, even if it's out of your comfort zone, and I promise you will not regret it 
                ≽^•⩊•^≼. Some other silly things you may like to know: I'm an ENFP-T, Capricorn, hufflepuff, and
                I love listening to music, art, and reading! As a senior, I know a lot about school, classes,
                clubs, and general life advice so don't be afraid to ask! Feel free to message me if you have 
                any questions, comments, concerns, or simply want to chat! I can't wait to experience this year 
                with y'all, and hopefully you'll end up loving our program and community as much as I do!!! (˶ˆᗜˆ˵) ☆*｡

                Hello!!! I’m c/TSgt Chloe Jiang and I’ll be your 2025-2026 Delta Flight Sergeant! I’m super 
                excited for my second year in this amazing program and I hope you are just as excited for what’s 
                to come :). Last year, I was on Academic Bowl, StellarXplorers, LG, PA, and SFDT (you should totally
                try out for all of these)! I’m also in the school’s Academic League which is super fun. I recommend 
                getting involved as much as possible in this program and at school. That way, you can take advantage
                of all the opportunities you’re exposed to and make the best out of them! You only have four years of high 
                school, and those years fly by so quickly :(. Anyway, I spend a lot of my time doing competitive dance and I 
                really love astronomy, math, and maybe even physics (slightly…). I love to crochet, bake, and play piano, and I
                love my ipad and apple pencil!! I also really like oat milk, dark green, and Christmas, and I tower over everyone 
                (I’m 7’6). I’m an ENTP (I don’t think this is accurate), a Slytherin, and a Sagittarius! If you ever have questions 
                about absolutely anything or just want someone to talk/rant to, don’t hesitate to reach out in-person or message me.
                I’m chronically online and always willing to hear about any obscure interests you may have!!
