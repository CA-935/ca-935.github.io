<p><b>*Our next Parent Club meeting is September 27th, 2017 (Wednesday).</b></br></br>

Scripps Ranch High School  AFJROTC is more than just a high school class. It is a community that fosters self-discipline, leadership, collaboration and personal responsibility. It's a program that is run by the students, guided by the best instructors and supported by outstanding parents.

The instructors are not super humans, but they are performing super human feats with these cadets. They are educators, coaches, mentors, and advisors, and they could not do all this without the support of the parents.

Each year the students set and achieve bigger and bigger goals. Our parents are instrumental to the success of the program by volunteering to drive for competitions, donating food, or just being at the competitions and cheering the cadets.

</br></br>As parents, there are several ways you can to be involved with the SRJROTC program:</br></br>

- Attend the Parent Club meetings held every couple months.</br>

- Be a driver for the competitions.</br>

- Donate food and supplies for the competitions and parties.</br>

- Help serve at the competitions and parties.</br>

- Make sure your cadet has everything they need for competitions and uniform day.</br>

- Be your cadets biggest cheerleader and attend the competitions.</br></br>
