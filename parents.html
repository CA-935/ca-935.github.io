                Scripps Ranch High School's AFJROTC program is more than just a high school class. It is a community that fosters self-discipline,
                leadership, collaboration and personal responsibility. It's a program that is run by the students, guided
                by the best instructors and supported by outstanding parents. The instructors are not super humans, but they
                are performing super human feats with these cadets. They are educators, coaches, mentors, and advisors, and
                they could not do all this without the support of the parents. Each year the students set and achieve bigger
                and bigger goals. Our parents are instrumental to the success of the program by volunteering to drive for
                competitions, donating food, or just being at the competitions and cheering the cadets.
