Scripps Ranch High School's AFJROTC program is more than just a high school class. 
It is a community that fosters self-discipline, leadership, collaboration and personal responsibility. 
It's a program that is run by the students, guided by the best instructors and supported by outstanding parents. 
The instructors are not super humans, but they are performing superhuman feats with these cadets. They are educators, 
coaches, mentors, and advisors, and they could not do all this without the support of the parents. Each year the students
set and achieve bigger and bigger goals. As parents we are instrumental to the success of the program by volunteering in 
the ways described below:
	</br>
		<ul>
                     <li>Attend the Parent Club meetings to learn what events are upcoming and support that is needed</li> 
                    </br>
                    <li>Be a driver for the competitions and events</li> 
                    </br>
                   <li>Donate food and supplies as needed for competitions and events</li> 
                    </br>
                   <li>Help serve food and drinks at competitions and events</li> 
                    </br>
                    <li>Make sure your cadet has everything they need for competitions and uniform day</li> 
                    </br>    
                   <li>Be your Cadetâ€™s biggest fan and supporter by attending competitions and events</li> 
                    </br>
                    <li>Provide moral support and cheering for them and their teammates as they strive to achieve their goals</li>
