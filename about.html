            <p>Scripps Ranch High School’s Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) CA-935th program, has been
                the number one JROTC unit in the San Diego Unified School District for many years. We value hard-work, friendship,
                and achievement, pushing our cadets not only to be their best but also to perform their best.</p>
            <p>Cadets have the opportunity to develop their leadership skills, through joining a drill or academic team or through
                individual competitions, and many cadets, as upperclassmen, hold positions that require great leadership
                and responsibility. They are all leaders among their peers, and they continue to grow in a place where they
                belong, excel and are rewarded.</p>
            <p>Cadets also have access to a positive educational experience in which their immediate and highest priority is
                to graduate high school and pursue higher educational opportunities. AFJROTC teaches the important values
                of citizenship, self-esteem, self-discipline, self-respect, service to the community, pride in belonging
                and personal, family and social responsibility with aims to instill these values beyond high school. Cadets
                also learn drill and ceremonies, as well as aviation/space technology in the program.

                    <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements that we have earned through teamwork, hard-work and dedication:</p>
