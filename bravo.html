            Hihi!! It’s your Bravo Flight 24-25 Commander, c/2dLt Liana Wong! Now let me introduce a little bit about myself. As a senior and fourth year in the program, within JROTC I take part in a lot of different things (tbh the most). For example: Flag Detail, Unarmed, APT, CyberPatriot, LG, PA and YPF! Previously, I was the Flag Detail Commander (23-24) and the Flag Detail NCO (22-23). While I may favor drill teams, special teams have a “special” (haha get it! laugh.) place in my heart. <33 When I’m not busy studying, sleeping, or eating, I enjoy my freetime!! AKA watching Youtube/Netflix abt girlypop and kdrama related things, spending time with friends/family, making crafts, overall taking care of my mental health! I especially love eating and will give you all the food recommendations, feel free to give me some too! Onto more serious matters, I hope to make your in-flight and JROTC experience as positively memorable as it can be. I’m excited to lead, teach, and mentor you. Be ready for a year of lots of fun, but also hard work, because that’s simply what it takes. There’s this quote, “If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself,” I believe this is a good one to take with you through life. To both first years and upperclassmen: I can assure you if you put in the time and effort to truly push yourself, you will reap the rewards. All in all, I sincerely promise you that the people you meet, experiences you gain, and memories you’ll make… will last you a lifetime. Feel free to talk to me about anything (music, jrotc/hs/life advice)! Let’s make this year, whether it be your first, last, or anything in between, an amazing one! *:･ﾟ✧!

                Heyo everyone! I am c/TSgt Jadelynn Doan, but some people call me Jade. I will be your Bravo Flight Sergeant and Flag Detail NCO for 2024-25! I am a sophomore and this is my second year in the program. In addition to Flag Detail, I am also a part of our unit’s Saber Fancy Drill Team :)) Joining AFJROTC allowed me to meet lots of awesome people, experience the fun and importance of teamwork, and learn how to step up with confidence. Some things I love to do are singing, listening to music (K-pop, J-pop, Indie/R&B), making origami, playing games, reading manga/manhwa, and hoarding cute things! More fun facts about me are that my favorite color is blue, I like pineapples on pizza, I was a choir kid for 4 years, and I put milk before cereal :3 If there were a mousetrap with sweets/Asian snacks inside I would definitely be caught... I am also Vietnamese and my personality type is ENFP /ᐠ･ω･ᐟ\. You can almost always find me online Discord, so please feel free to ask some questions or yap about anything anytime! I am su-su-su-su-super excited to get to know you all this school year!!!
