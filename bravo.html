            <p>Bravo Flight Commander: JJ O'Connell <br>
                <a href="mailto: jjoconnelliv@gmail.com">jjoconnelliv@gmail.com</a><br><p>What’s cracking on this fine day, folks? I’m c/2d Lt JJ O’Connell and I will be this year’s Bravo Flight Commander. Within the unit, I am an active current member of StellarXplorers and Academic Team. This year, I am a Junior, and RO has been my favorite thing throughout all of high school, and a great community to exercise my strengths and improve my weaknesses. All it takes is an open mind and a little bit of diligence. Outside of school, I enjoy playing and listening to music constantly (mostly metal, but I like a bit of pretty much everything), fishing at a drastically below average level, and painfully rooting on the San Diego Padres. RO is unlike anything else in high school, and if you put in the effort, you’ll gain endless memories and lessons to carry with you to anything. I’m here to be not just a flight commander, but a friend to anyone who needs one. So don’t hesitate to hit me up for anything. I’m excited for the year to come and our time together!/p>
