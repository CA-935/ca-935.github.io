            <p>Bravo Flight Commander: JJ O'Connell <br>
                <a href="mailto: jjoconnelliv@gmail.com">jjoconnelliv@gmail.com</a><br>(619)-888-7908<br>What’s cracking on this fine day, folks? I’m c/2d Lt JJ O’Connell and I will be this year’s Bravo Flight Commander. Within the unit, I am an active current member of StellarXplorers and Academic Team. This year, I am a Junior, and RO has been my favorite thing throughout all of high school, and a great community to exercise my strengths and improve my weaknesses. All it takes is an open mind and a little bit of diligence. Outside of school, I enjoy playing and listening to music constantly (mostly metal, but I like a bit of pretty much everything), fishing at a drastically below average level, and painfully rooting on the San Diego Padres. RO is unlike anything else in high school, and if you put in the effort, you’ll gain endless memories and lessons to carry with you to anything. I’m here to be not just a flight commander, but a friend to anyone who needs one. So don’t hesitate to hit me up for anything. I’m excited for the year to come and our time together!/p>

            <p>Bravo Flight Sergeant: Veer Chopra <br>
                         <a href="mailto:veerchopra28@gmail.com">veerchopra28@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-848-4283<br>Yoyo, I hope you are all doing well on this fine day! My name is Veer Chopra, and I’ll be your Bravo flight sergeant. I am a sophomore attending SRHS, and CA-935th is one of the best units you could ever be in. Within our program, I am involved in Color Guard, Kitty Hawk, and I am a CyberPatriot NCO, so if you have any questions relating to that, please reach out to me! Outside of RO, I am an officer in clubs (Physics, Math, YSJ), and robotics (FRC and FTC). I also coach both Science Olympiad and CyberPatriot to MMS Students. You will also find me chilling with friends, listening to Hindi songs, or just enjoying life. I am so happy you all decided to join RO, as it is one of the best life-changing experiences you can participate in. Take as many opportunities as you can handle. If you have any questions or want to talk to me, I’m always here for you! I’m very excited to get to know you all!</p>
