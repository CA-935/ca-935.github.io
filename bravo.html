          WHAT’S UP PARTY PEOPLE?!?! I’m c/2d Lt Saanvi Iyer, your Bravo flight commander for the 2025-26 school year. This will be my 3rd year in AFJROTC, and I’m more excited about it than ever. It’s crazy to think that I was once an 8th grader, hesitant to join AFJROTC because I thought I was obligated to join the military through the program. However, after (thankfully) clearing things up with my friends in the program, I decided to take a chance and join. It’s safe to say that it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made! The community, teams, and things you learn in AFJROTC are so amazing and will stay with you forever. The beauty of the program is that no matter who you are, there is always something for you. For a little bit about me, I’m a Kitty Hawk tutor in the unit, the NHS president, and I participate in Science Olympiad. I’ve been a Carnatic music (Indian classical) singer for 13 years now, and I play the piano. My favorite sport is volleyball, my favorite color is teal, my favorite artists are Tate McRae, Sabrina Carpenter, and The Weeknd (and honestly so much more, here’s my Spotify) and I LOVE LOVE LOVE fruits. I love to travel; my favorite places I’ve been to are Bali, Italy, Hawaii, Mexico! I’m an ENTP-A, a Gryffindor, and a Sagittarius, so I love to talk about literally anything (yes, anything), so don’t ever hesitate to reach out to me, whether it’s for questions or if you just need someone to rant to :) Aritri and I (the best staff fr) are looking forward to meeting and working with you all this year!

               HEY YALL!!! My name is c/TSgt Aritri Banerjee, and I am your Bravo Flight Sergeant for the 2025-2026 school year! I’m a sophomore this year, and this is my second year in AFJROTC! I first joined JROTC as a PE alternative, and forced my best friend (c/TSgt Ashley Kim) to join me. I think it is safe to say that joining was definitely one of the BEST decisions I have ever made! This program is a place for everyone to be themselves. Regardless of who you are or what interests you have, there is ALWAYS something for everyone! In the previous year, I was on Armed Team and was a Kitty Hawk tutor, but I’m hoping to get more involved this year! Some fun facts about me: I LOVE music! I sing, play guitar, and blast (unhealthy) amounts of music into my ears 24/7. Some of my favorite artists are Conan Gray, Tyler, the Creator, Radiohead, and Chappell Roan (Here’s my Spotify for more). I also love to read, so if you have any book recs, let me know! I’m an ISFP-T, a Libra, a Percy Jackson nerd, and Ashley Kim’s conjoined twin! I’m also a D1 yapper, and I can (and will) talk about literally ANYTHING! If you ever have any questions or just feel like yapping, Saanvi (the best flight commander EVER) and I are always here for you! I hope that I can help you find your place in this program!
