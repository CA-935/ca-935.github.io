            </h2>
            <p>Welcome to CA-935, Air Force JROTC!</p>
            <p>I’m excited to begin my 2nd year with the OUTSTANDING CA-935 Program!  During my 9 years of AFJROTC in SoCal,
                I’ve witnessed the incredible accomplishments and dominating spirit of the cadets and leaders here at Scripps
                Ranch. As you already know, MSgt T has developed one of the top units in AFJROTC and I’m looking forward to 
                joining him in leading this unit.  I expect to be focused on learning this year and look forward to getting
                to know the cadets of CA-935.  I fully support the mission of AFJROTC - "Develop citizens of character dedicated 
                to serving their nation and community"  and believe the curriculum and activities in this program fully support this mission.</p>
            <p>This year I will be teaching the “Milestones in Aviation History” (AS-100) learning/ module/ curriculum to the freshmen & 
                first year cadets and “Cultural Studies An Introduction to Global Awareness” (AS-220) to all upperclassmen cadets.</p>
