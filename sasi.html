                <b>Maj James Francis</b>
            </h2>
            <p>Welcome cadets, students, and families to CA-935, the best high school cadet corp in San Diego!</p>
            <p> We are a cadet led/cadet driven corp that excels in drill, academics, athletics, and all things JROTC. We fully support the 
                mission of "Developing citizens of character dedicated to serving their nation and community". I personally look forward to 
                continuing to support our cadets, from finding their super power to using their voices to influence and lead others; I am 
                all in for Scripps Ranch High School US AFJROTC!  </p>

                <b>Air Force Career</b>
            </h3>
            <p>Maj Francis grew up in Portland, Oregon and graduated from the USAF Academy in 1994 as a 2nd lieutenant. His first assignment 
                was as an administrative officer for the 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Anchorage.  He enjoyed all of the 
                outdoor pursuits that Alaska has to offer and hopes to return one day. Maj Francis then went on to flight school in Texas where 
                he earned an MC-130P Combat Shadow stationed at Royal Air Force Base Mildenhall, UK. He flew all over Europe as a copilot on 
                the Shadow, learning night vision goggle low level in the mountains of Scotland, airdrop and airland with the US special forces 
                stationed at Stuttgart, Germany, and aerial refueling with the MH-53 Pave Low helicopters of the 21st Special Operations Squadron 
                across the ramp at Mildenhall. He became an aircraft commander post 9/11 and deployed multiple times for Operation Iraqi Freedom 
                and Operation Enduring Freedom. Maj Francis went on to fly MC-130Ps at Hurlburt Field, Florida as an instructor. </p>
            <p>In the second half of his career, Maj Francis became a combat aviation advisor, leading teams overseas to train, advise, and assist 
                allies, often in foreign aircraft. The relationships he built with the aircrews and air force leadership in the Republic of Korea, 
                the Republic of the Philippines, the Republic of Poland, and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania give him many fond memories and 
                shaped who he is today.  </p>
