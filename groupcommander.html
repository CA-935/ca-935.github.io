			<p>Hello to all cadets, parents, and guests. I’m c/Col JJ O’Connell, and I’m the CA-935 Cadet Group Commander. My job is to lead the corps, 
				working with and managing the activities of other 8 members of the Senior Staff. Together our goal is to provide the most fulfilling
				experience for any cadet in the corps who seeks opportunity and leadership.</p>

			<p>This unit is extremely successful, and every aspect from our Academic Bowl to our Color Guard is laced with experience and pride. 
				Without a doubt, the reason for our success is the willingness of cadet leaders to be themselves and encourage the same of 
				others, while maintaining respect for military structure and tradition.</p>

			<p>Throughout my time in the unit, I’ve been involved in StellarXplorers, Academic Bowl, Youth Physical Fitness, Armed Fancy Drill Team,
				Logistics, and Public Affairs. Additionally, I’ve led two different flights as a commander and a sergeant. I’ve met countless 
				people who have influenced how I lead fellow cadets and my own life. Many of these people have become my closest friends, while 
				others have impacted me in a way that they may not know about.</p>

			<p>The beauty of this program is just that. Nowhere else can someone your own age inspire you. Fostering a community in which that can continue is essential to me.</p>

			<p>I look forward to all the new opportunities I’ll face, as well as providing the same for others. Thank you for taking an interest in our unit.</p>

			<p>c/Col JJ O’Connell</p>
