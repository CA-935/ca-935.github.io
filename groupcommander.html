			<p>Dear parents, cadets, and surprise guests,</p>

			<p>Welcome to CA-935th which, I can say without bias, is the best corps you will come across. I’m 
				c/Col Julia Zou and it’s a great privilege for me to be the Group Commander of this unit 
				for the academic year 2025-2026. In my position I am responsible for the well-being and discipline 
				of the whole unit. I oversee a staff of eight incredibly talented people and together we are known as 
				Senior Staff. We plan events, oversee our teams, and continue CA-935th’s legacy in both Scripps 
				Ranch High School and the surrounding community. Collectively, our goal is to build leaders and 
				make our unit a place where everyone can call home.</p>

			<p>CA-935th is one of the most successful units nationwide (I’m not one to brag usually but 
				you have to humor me this one time). We receive national recognition for our reputable CyberPatriot 
				and Academic Bowl team, to our various drill competitions each year. Within the San Diego 
				Unified School District, we have taken the number one unit award countless years in a row. Our 
				annual Holiday Canned Food Drive has contributed the largest donation to the San Diego Food 
				Bank in the county. And we do so much more volunteering throughout the year. On the outside, 
				it’s no surprise that our unit is one of the best in the country.</p>

			<p>But I think our real success lies within our corps. Our goal has always been to “build citizens of 
				character” and that means responsible, disciplined, students who show respect to others. We 
				pride ourselves in preparing our cadets for life beyond high school by giving them an opportunity 
				to be a leader and to make a difference in something they care about. Our accomplishments are 
				only possible because of the hard work and passion each cadet puts in. So I promise, you would 
				have to search very hard to find more motivated high school students than the cadets in our corps.</p>

			<p>At its core, our unit is a family. We value an interconnectedness among our cadets, encouraging 
				students to try new things and meet new people. I, myself, can attest to this. I joined this unit 
				with no plan for what I wanted to do but I explored my interests; they led me to the Saber Fancy 
				Drill Team and our Academic Bowl team and, eventually, here. But most importantly, I have built 
				friendships that lasted throughout high school and memories that will stay with me for even 
				longer. CA-935th has helped me grow into the person I am today. I hope my experiences will 
				show you that our unit is full of opportunities for cadets to channel their passion and talent.</p>

			<p>CA-935th is a place where people find belonging and acceptance. It is a place that can transform 
				and enrich people’s high school experience. As Group Commander, I’m so excited to help 
				continue that vision this year. Thank you for taking an interest in our corps.<p>
