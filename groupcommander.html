			<p>To all cadets, parents, and guests, welcome. I’m c/Col Ryan Min, and I’m the Group Commander for CA-935th AFJROTC. 
				In this position, I’m responsible for leading the corps, working with and overseeing the other eight members 
				of Senior Staff to keep the unit running smoothly. Together, our goal is to ensure that every cadet in the 
				program has a fulfilling experience as they make their journey into leadership.</p>

			<p>CA-935th is one of the most successful units around, with consistent success across all fields. And from our 
				nationally-recognized CyberPatriot team to our dedicated Awareness Presentation Team, it’s the cadets who 
				make this success possible. Their passion and dedication, along with a traditional emphasis on military 
				structure and respect, are the foundation of the corps.</p>

			<p>However, what truly makes CA-935th unique is the inherent level of camaraderie and welcome. Since my very first 
				day in the program, I’ve always felt like I was among friends, and many of the closest bonds I’ve formed in 
				high school have been with fellow cadets. CA-935th is a place where people’s quirks and talents are recognized 
				and celebrated, where taking initiative is rewarded, and where our doors are always open to anyone looking to 
				get the most out of their time in high school.</p>

			<p>Throughout my time in the unit, I’ve been a part of Kitty Hawk, Saber Fancy Drill Team, and Logistics, and have had 
				the chance to lead Academic Bowl as both a sergeant and a commander. I’ve been able to meet a multitude of people, 
				some younger, some older, and some of whom were role models that continue to inspire me to this day. Now, I hope 
				to serve in the same role they once did, and to inspire the next generation of cadets to one day do the same.</p>

			<p>Everyone deserves a memorable high school experience, and with your help, I look forward to making it happen. 
				Thank you for taking an interest in our corps.</p>

			<p>c/Col Ryan Min</p>
