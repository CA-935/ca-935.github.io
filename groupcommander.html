			<p> Hello cadets, parents, staff, and visitors!</p> 
				
			<p> I'm Hilary Nguyen, the Group Commander for the 22-23 school year.  I oversee the 8 other leaders on our unit's Senior Staff and work with our ASI and administration to continue our long-standing reputation of excellence.  I'm thrilled for this chance to give back to this wonderful community, and I believe wholeheartedly that I will exit senior year a better person than I entered it.  How could I not when I'm surrounded by extraordinary, inspiring cadets every day? </p>
			
			<p> I knew stepping into 9th grade that I wanted to get to this position and excel within my other activities.  So, I threw myself in headfirst.  I joined our Kitty Hawk tutoring program.  I learned how to pay respect to our flags through Flag Detail.  I refined my public speaking skills through our Awareness Presentation Team.  I led my flight to win RO Day—not once, but twice.  My 9-year-old self never would have believed that I was able to balance so much.
			</p>
			
			<p> That’s what I learned in high school: to figure it out, just go for it.  Determination never failed me, but in the moments where I failed to determine my course forward, I had an amazing and supportive group of cadets around me to keep me going.  Yes, I put in the work, but the cadets are my motivation for it all. </p>
			
			<p>My goal is to encourage cadets to take advantage of the wealth of opportunities around them.  There is so much that such a stellar program like this can provide for you.  Everything and everyone you encounter holds a wealth of knowledge.  You take a lesson, and you give your loyalty and respect in return.  That’s how you become someone you’re proud of. </p>
			
			<p>I cannot wait to seize this year and create an enriching experience for our cadets!  Thank you for honoring me with your trust.</p>
