			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
			<p>I am cadet Colonel John Jack, a senior at Scripps Ranch High School and the Unit Commander for SRHSâ€™ CA-935th Air Force Junior ROTC program for the 2017-2018 school year.</p>
			<p>Our unit, ranked first among all JROTC units in the San Diego Unified School District, provides many different opportunities for cadets to develop and tailor their 
			leadership skills, in addition to contributing to their character morally, mentally, and physically.</p>
			<p>Whether it be military drill, academics, athletics, or community service, CA-935th never fails to rise to the top. We have placed first in the JROTC Academic 
			Bowl Nationals and first in the JROTC Youth Physical Fitness Competition for the past two years, along with taking many first places in JROTC military drill competitions. 
			Thanks to its exceptional and motivated cadets, instructors, and supportive parents, CA-935th is among the best of the best.</p>
			<p>My goal for this upcoming school year is to maintain and exceed what our corps has already achieved, and to develop a corps that is cohesive and team-orientated; CA-935th 
			is not just any other corps -- it is a family.</p>
