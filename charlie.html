            <a href = "mailto: Rgrico001@gmail.com ">Rgrico001@gmail.com </a><br>(619)-408-5511<br>Can I get uhhhhhhh. Wassup guys it's c/2d Lt Richard Rico and I will be your Charlie Flight commander for this year. This will be my 4th year in the program and I am very excited. In RO, I am part of Color Guard, Logistics, APT, and flag detail. Outside of RO I just do npc activities such as walking my fish, folding the dishes, and reading my favorite movies. I have done a lot in this program so if you have any questions, feel free to ask. You guys can also go ahead and message me on anything (Discord, insta, snap, messages, reddit, life360, linkedin, roblox, xbox, letter, carrier pigeon, anish, etc.) if you just want to talk about anything, not just RO related. This program is really cool (its lit) and I can't wait to meet all of you guys (exclamation mark).

            <p>Charlie Flight Sergeant: Angelina Dinh<br>
          <a href = "mailto: adinh726@gmail.com">adinh726@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-349-3098<br>Hello everyone! I am c/TSgt Angie Dinh (well, my actual name is "Angelina" but just please call me "Angie") and I'll be your Charlie Flight Sergeant this school year! I'm a sophomore and this is my second year in this program. Within our RO unit, I am a part of the Unarmed Fancy Drill Team and Logistics. Outside of RO, I really don't do much other than casually play games (valorant is the bane of my entire existence), listen to my “cringe” genres of music, bake desserts (kenny-approved), hang out with friends, and get more broke with each passing day. High school is full of new experiences and opportunities, and RO will only elevate your high school experience as long as you put the effort into it. Coming into this program was literally LIFE-CHANGING for me, and it can possibly change your life too. Come talk or shoot me a message whenever, wherever. I'm always down to talk about anything, not just RO related stuff. If you can't find me, I'll probably be in the grinder. I can't wait to talk to y'all and make it a fantastic year with memories I'll never forget!
