                    Beep beep! I am c/2d Lt Sol Pham and I am honored to serve as your Charlie Flight Commander (and Awards Officer) for the 2025-2026 school year! I am a junior and this will be my third year in AFJROTC. When I first joined, I thought I’d feel out of place… but it’s safe to say that I’ve found my home away from home amongst the amazing people in this program, and have gotten very involved since then! I’m a third year on our unit’s GOATED Armed Fancy Drill Team (JOIN ARMED TEAM! ★) and I’ve been/am on Public Affairs, Logistics, Flag Detail, Operations Staff, and now also Logistics Staff! My greatest advice to you if you’re hesitant about talking to that cool upperclassmen or trying out for a team is to Just Do It™. You only have so many years in high school, so take risks and live to the fullest, because there’s no limit to your abilities as long as you give yourself and others a chance. I love creative writing, tinkering with my 3DS, Studio Investigrave, Tamagotchis, Tokidoki, Pokemon cards, decking my bags out in the loudest keychains ever, and have a variety of other niche interests, which I will unhesitatingly yap about. Always feel free to shoot me a message (especially if you’re in need of 3DS modding advice) and if you see me around, say hi! And if anyone asks, I am 6’4.

                Hi guys, I'm Kyan Bach from Charlie Flight and I like the feeling of arriving home from school. Last year, I joined RO because all my indian friends joined RO and since they’re smart so I just joined them. Turns out, doing what my Indian friends did was the right choice! Honestly, the best part about RO is the amount of fun you have participating in RO in general. If you put yourself out there and let others get to know who you are, being in RO will be one of the best experiences you will have in high school. Seriously, if you talk to Noah Beyer, your life WILL CHANGE. In all seriousness, I’ve seen people who just push away and not bring a good experience to RO, you don’t want that.Yes yes good advice. A bit about me is that I enjoy playing basketball and I’m actually better than a certain living brick Tran-Malan. I like collecting Pokemon Cards I guess (If you wanna trade pls hit me up). Also, sleeping is fun. Ok this paragraph is getting quite long so bye and join saber. Love y’all <3.
