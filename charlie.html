                    What’s up, guys? Hi, I’m c/2d Lt Julia Zou; I’m a third year in the program and I’ll be the Charlie Flight Commander for 2024-2025! I initially joined JROTC because most of my friends wanted to, and I heard that being in the program looked good on college applications (got to think in the big picture haha). I knew I wanted to get involved, but I could never have imagined how much I came to feel at ease in the corps. Over the years, I joined our Saber Fancy Drill Team, Academic Bowl, and our Operations Staff (yay!), and what I’ve learned from all of it is to take chances because you’ll never know how much passion you can develop for these opportunities! So please, try out things that you’re interested in and meet new people…like me! So on that note, a little bit about moi. My favorite genre of film is murder mystery ‘cause I’m just a sucker for old detective shows, I love listening to K-Pop (if you’ll indulge me, I will never stop talking about it), my favorite color is yellow, and I’m highly against pineapple on pizza. Though you might disagree with me on that last fact, I would love to meet all of you so feel free to talk to me whenever. It’s junior year for me, but I have a feeling that this year is going to be super fun, so see you around!

                Beep beep. I’m c/TSgt Sol Pham and I will be your Charlie Flight Sergeant for this year :) I am a sophomore and this will be my second year in AFJROTC. Originally, I joined from being encouraged by friends and wanting to escape PE’s millions of laps, but I ended up finding my home away from home amongst all of the lovely people in this program <3 I’m a proud member of this unit’s Armed Fancy Drill Team (LET’S GO ARMED TEAM), and previously, was a Public Affairs and Logistics representative. My interests include creative writing, reading, and RPG/VN games to name a few; if I listed all of my interests, I would likely exceed the word limit. I used to be a theater kid, I like cats, and I’m a huge Mitski and TV Girl fan :,) One of my biggest pieces of advice to first-years is to seize the opportunities in front of you— introduce yourself to that upperclassmen you admire, try out for the team(s) you’ve been eyeing, don’t be afraid to be known— because you never know how greatly taking initiative will impact your future. If you ever see me around, say hi! Or else, I will do it myself. I will. I’m ecstatic to meet you all and lead Charlie Flight alongside Julia this year, and I hope to be a mentor to all of you cadets, regardless of flight. Always feel free to reach out. •‿•
