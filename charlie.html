                    Hello. My name is c/2ndLt Kenneth Kim, but you can call me Kenny. I'll be your 2023-2024 Charlie Flight commander. I am a third-year cadet in this program. I enjoy eating, with rice being my favorite. I would consider myself a picky eater, and I am well-versed in the art of sleeping. I can't help but take a daily nap. JROTC may seem like just another one of your classes, but it's as fun as you make it. I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you. :)

                Hi hello, I’m c/TSgt Hailey Shin, your (beloved) Charlie Flight Sergeant! I’m a sophomore at SRHS and have a full-time job being addicted to cats. In our unit, I’m primarily focused on my job taking care of my flight, Armed Fancy Drill Team, and being a laughing stock for your fellow AFJROTC cadets. Because this program has helped me so much in growing as a person and a leader and finding a family at SRHS, I try my best to uplift our corps and the cadets + instructors that its composed of. Our little family at CA-935th has always encouraged me to have confidence in my abilities and take initiative for opportunities to grow. I watch it to continually do so with every new cadet who joins our unit and I’m very proud to be part of CA-935th! With the free time I do have, I usually spend it sleeping, eating good food, hanging out with my friends, googling horrible dad jokes to torment my superiors with, swimming, skateboarding, ice skating, and staring at cat memes (I love cats). Although I’m constantly being a little odd, if you need someone to talk to, feel free and welcome to reach out C: I’m always willing to talk over DM or in person if you need some encouraging words or laughs or help with anything I can! Very honored to be one of your 22-23 flight staff :)
