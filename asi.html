           <p>
            </p>
            <p>Welcome to CA-935, Air Force JROTC!</p>
            <p>I’m excited to begin my 1st year of teaching JROTC at one of the best public schools in the nation, Scripps Ranch High School. The goal of our program is to propel
                cadets/students to reach their max potential by becoming a better version of themselves through comradery, management, guidance, and teamwork. We do this by offering
                courses in life skills, effective communication, leadership education, physical fitness/education, and aerospace science courses.</p>
            <p>This year I will be teaching the “Citizenship, Character, and Air Force Tradition” (LE-100) learning/ module/ curriculum to the freshmen & first year cadets and
                “Communication, Awareness, and Leadership” (LE-200) to all upperclassmen cadets.</p>
            <p>I am very proud and honored to tell you that we have been the #1 Unit in the San Diego Unified School District out of 14 JROTC programs which encompasses over 2,200
                cadets. Our program has continued this legacy of excellence for several years and has been awarded the Distinguished Unit with Merit by HQ’s Air Force JROTC for 11
                consecutive years. This has been possible due to the high-caliber and motivated cadets that continue to do great things in our program year after year!</p>

                        <b>Air Force Career</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>Senior Master Sergeant Martin Guardado graduated from Mission Bay High School in
                        June of 2000 and entered Active-Duty Air Force on 4 February 2003. Following Basic
                        Military Training (BMT) and Security Forces Technical Training School (TTS) at
                        Lackland AFB, TX, he was assigned to his first duty station at the 90th Missile Security

                        2008, he made the decision to accept a special duty assignment as a recruiter.
                        He was assigned to the 352d Recruiting Squadron at March AFB, CA, where he recruited from a
                        geographically separated satellite office in Chula Vista, CA. In 2013, after completing
                        his recruiting assignment, Sergeant Guardado was transferred back to his original

                        <p> In 2014, he separated from Active Duty and joined 
                        the Air Force Reserve as a full-time recruiter. For the next 11 years, he held several
                        assignments as a Line, Lead, In-Service, and Flight Chief recruiter. These assignments
                        included locations at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, AZ; Vandenberg AFB, Lompoc, CA;
