            <p>Armed Team requires a combination of strength, coordination, skill, discipline, timing, and consistency to perfect the movements that are taught. 
                We work together as a family to teach all members of the team how to perform in sync with precision. It is required that incoming members of 
                the armed fancy drill team would learn how to be fearless, and strong, and have the motivation to practice after school every day. Our instructors 
                for the years 24-25 will be c/2d Lt Julian Schiff and c/TSgt Bridge Han.
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2023-2024 School Year:</p>
