        <p>Armed Team requires a combination of strength, coordination, skill, timing, and consistency to perfect the movements 
		that are taught. We work together as a family to teach all members of the team how to perform in sync with precision. It 
		is required that incoming members of armed fancy drill team would learn how to be fearless, strong, and have a motivation 
		to practice after school every day. Our instructors for the year of 17-18 will be c/Capt Anton Phan and c/MSgt Jordan Almaas.</p>
		<p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2016-2017 School Year:</p>
		<p class="about_center"><b>Best Drill Platoon (Brigade): 1st Place</br>
        Best Drill Squadron (Brigade): 3rd Place</br>
		Best Drilled 1st Year (Brigade): 1st Place</br>
