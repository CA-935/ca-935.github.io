Congratulations to c/Col Elliot Mell and c/Col Song Kang for making it onto the 23-24 Brigade staff! 

Elliot will be the district J-4 Logistics Officer and Song will be the district J-5 Public Affairs Officer within the Joint Brigade staff. Once again, congratulations to both cadets for making it! Both cadets worked very hard to get to this position, and sure enough, their hard work has very much paid off.
