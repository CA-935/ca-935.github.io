Congratulations to c/Col Ryan Min and c/LtCol Jackeline Du for being the 2024-2025 academic school year's group and deputy commanders. Now that the first few members of next year's senior staff have been chosen, it is time for new cadets to engage in General Staff positions of the next year. Ryan and Jaqqie have created a presentation on general staff, informing you about the various squadrons and positions, the expectations, the application process, and the interview process, along with some helpful advice to guide you!
