## Kebab Shop Fundraiser

Cadets,

The Kebab Shop Fundraiser is **ALL DAY** on February 13th, 2018. Please present this flyer at checkout and tell the cashier that you're supporting CA-935th! Our corps receives 50% of all purchases back. Remember, this flyer will only work at the Mira Mesa location located at 9450 Mira Mesa Blvd San Diego, CA 92126 (see below).

Fundraisers help fund our unit, allowing us to waive fees for cadets and to finance our endeavours.
