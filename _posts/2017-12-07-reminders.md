---

Here's a few reminders for the upcoming two weeks:

- RO Day permission slips due by Friday (No Exceptions!)
- Bring $5 for lunch if you want lunch on RO Day. Give it to your flight commander or sergeant.
- Canned food drive ends December 13th 2017.
- Coin battle also ends December 13th 2017.

Two and a half weeks remaining before Winter Break! Make sure to study and do well on your tests before the break.
