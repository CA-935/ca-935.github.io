            <p>CA-935th's Academic Team is a close-knit group that trains to answer Jeopardy-style questions from a variety of different categories. They compete in two
                competitions throughout the year. The first one, the brigade competition, is held at high schools across San Diego, and CA-935th's cadets are currently the 
                reigning champs! The second competition is the Joint Leadership and Academic Bowl (JLAB) nationals in Washington, D.C. The team has a variety of opportunities
                for recognition, including ribbons, medals, trophies, and Stillwell points for the unit. This year, c/2d Lt Yoonah Lee and c/TSgt Kamryn Liu will be leading 
                CA-935th's Academic Bowl team to the championship! </p>
