            <p>The Academic Team shows off its knowledge in competitions by racing to answer questions in a variety of different categories. They compete in brigade competitions at high schools in San Diego as well as the Joint Leadership and Academic Bowl (JLAB) nationals in Washington, D.C. The team has opportunities to win medals, Stillwell points, and a trophy from the brigade academic bowl and even more awards at JLAB nationals. This year, c/MSgt Ryan Min and c/TSgt Paul Macapinlac will be leading CA-935th's Academic Bowl team to the championship!</p>
