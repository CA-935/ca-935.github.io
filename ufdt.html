            <p>Unarmed Fancy Drill Team is a complex drill team that consists of cadets using mainly their hands and feet to
                create unique sounds through stomps and slaps. Members of the team do not use any weapons or flags (hence
                the name Unarmed). However this doesn't stop them from being intense throughout the school year of competitions.
                Our Unarmed team has currently been awarded the best Unarmed Fancy Drill Team in the San Diego Unified School
                District as it has been for the past two years. As for the 2017-2018 school year, the team will be led by
                c/2nd Lt. Llana Monteclar and c/MSgt Amanda Ong. We hope to see you on our team! </p>
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2017-2018 School Year:</p>
