            <p> Unarmed is all about sharpness and synchronization. We utilize slapping and stomping to create a variety of moves. We have nearly sixty moves that we put together
                in unique formations to create routines for various events and competitions. Unarmed not only has distinctive moves, but also friendly members who are dedicated 
                to our team and its success. This year, our team is led by c/2d Lt Katherine Kwon, and c/TSgt Ryan Mansour. The team does not possess weapons, but that doesnâ€™t make 
                it any less impressive. All the hard work that is put in pays off in victory and fun! </p>
            <p>Below are some of our proudest achievements during the 2024-2025 School Year:</p>
